## Why hello there

This repository serves as a way to showcase the source code to my website and to keep me vigilant in my use of source control for small personal projects

### Credits
Website built using the wonderful [Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org/ "Mojolicious Homepage") framework.

I'm neither interested nor very good at front end design. Much of the formatting is taken directly from the [Mojolicious website source code](https://github.com/mojolicious/mojolicious.org "Mojolicious Website Github").
